# Executive Summary

## Initial Briefing - 30th May 2025

**Date of Conversation:** 30th May 2025 1800-2000hrs  
**Participants:**
- Speaker (Main strategist, referred to as "Speaker")
- Other Speaker (Advisor/Collaborator, referred to as "Other Speaker")

This document captures a strategic discussion between two individuals (Speaker and Other Speaker) about a local campaign concerning proposed traffic management changes to Shore Road in Swanage. The primary goal of the campaign is to maintain two-way traffic and oppose measures like road closure or a one-way system. 

The conversation delves into analyzing the council's survey, identifying target audiences, crafting messaging, devising communication tactics, and considering potential challenges. Key themes include the perceived bias in the official survey, the importance of mobilizing underrepresented groups (especially youth), and the need for a multi-pronged approach involving direct canvassing, social media, and engagement with local authorities. 

A significant discovery is a "hack" to complete the survey in approximately 20 seconds by answering only three mandatory questions, which forms a cornerstone of their strategy to increase participation.

## Key Campaign Elements

- **Survey Analysis:** Focus on the 3 mandatory questions "hack" (20 seconds vs 20 minutes)
- **Target Demographics:** Young population, De Moulham Road residents, beach hut owners
- **Messaging:** Freedom, democratic rights, community impact
- **Tactics:** Flyers with QR codes, social media, direct canvassing
- **Timeline:** June 29th survey deadline creates urgency

## Strategic Overview

The campaign seeks to preserve Shore Road as a two-way thoroughfare through strategic mobilization of community support, challenging the council's survey methodology, and presenting evidence-based arguments for maintaining current traffic arrangements while addressing legitimate safety concerns through alternative measures.
