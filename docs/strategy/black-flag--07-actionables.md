# Black Flag: Actionable Items & Next Steps

While the conversation is primarily strategic and analytical, several clear actionable items and next steps emerge, either explicitly stated or strongly implied by the discussion. These actions form the practical backbone of the campaign to save Shore Road's two-way traffic system.

- **7.1. Create Facebook Page & Social Media Presence:**
    This is identified as an immediate priority. The Speaker states, "I'm going to create my own Facebook page" (00:03:39), and later, "I'm not on Facebook... I'm not in Insta. So really I need Facebook, need Insta, need to get on there quickly, sharing it" (02:33:00 - 02:36:00). The Other Speaker is seen as someone who can facilitate this rapidly: "This is what you can do this much quicker than me, just set it up, get it going" (00:03:43). This digital hub will be crucial for disseminating information about the survey "hack," sharing updates, rallying support, and potentially hosting visual campaign materials. The use of Linktree (02:56:30) is also an actionable item to consolidate these online presences.
  - *Specific next steps: Register a campaign name/handle for Facebook and Instagram. Design a simple profile picture/banner. Populate the page with initial posts explaining the campaign and the survey "hack."*

- **7.2. Design and Print Flyers with QR Code:**
    The production of "a load of little cheap flyers... real simple" (00:03:05) is a core tactic. These flyers need to be designed with a clear, concise message: "Campaign: Keep Swanage Two-Way Traffic / Shore Road Two-Way Traffic," explicit instructions on answering only questions 1, 24, and 26 (and choosing Option 3), and a prominent "Scan Me" QR code linking directly to the survey (00:03:25). The Speaker envisions mass distribution: "plaster[ing] them up everywhere" (01:46:00) and handing them out.
  - *Specific next steps: Finalize flyer wording and design. Source cost-effective printing. Plan distribution strategy (target areas, volunteers if any).*

- **7.3. Conduct Sentiment Analysis of the Survey:**
    The Other Speaker is tasked with this: "I'm going to ask for you to do some sentiment analysis, which I am going to present at council" (00:02:36). This involves a technical examination of the council's survey to identify and document leading questions, biased phrasing, or structural elements that could unfairly influence responses. The findings will be crucial for challenging the legitimacy of the survey's results when presenting to Dorset County Council.
  - *Specific next steps: The Other Speaker needs to obtain the full survey text and apply analytical methods to identify and categorize biased elements, preparing a report or summary for the Speaker.*

- **7.4. Canvas Key Demographics (Youth, De Moulham Road Residents):**
    Direct, face-to-face canvassing is already underway and will be intensified. The Speaker plans to "knock on their doors" (01:42:30) in areas like De Moulham Road, where residents are already concerned about overflow parking. A significant focus will be on reaching the "young population" (00:01:58), perhaps in social hubs or areas they frequent, to explain the direct impact on their ability to use Shore Road and to teach them the survey "hack."
  - *Specific next steps: Identify key locations and times for canvassing different demographics. Prepare a concise "doorstep script" or talking points. Train any volunteers involved in canvassing.*

- **7.5. Network with "Super Spreaders" and Local Councillors:**
    The campaign will actively leverage existing social networks. This involves engaging "super spreaders" – influential local individuals like Carl White (03:20:00) and Angelo Wiggins (00:00:13) – to amplify the message within their circles. Simultaneously, the Speaker will "network with the councillors" (00:07:35) at both Swanage Town Council and Dorset County Council, aiming to present the campaign's concerns, gather intelligence, and potentially sway opinions.
  - *Specific next steps: Compile a list of potential "super spreaders" and key councillors. Develop a strategy for approaching each, tailored to their likely interests and influence.*

- **7.6. Prepare Presentations for Council Meetings:**
    Formal engagement with Dorset County Council is a critical long-term goal. This will involve collating all gathered evidence: the sentiment analysis of the survey, data on underrepresentation (e.g., from the survey hack participation vs. full survey data if accessible), testimonies from affected residents, and a clear articulation of the campaign's arguments against the proposed changes and in favor of Option 3. The Speaker mentions wanting to "bring up" the Mayor's alleged misinformation at the County Hall (02:10:00, 02:17:00).
  - *Specific next steps: Identify dates for relevant council meetings. Research procedures for public speaking/submissions. Draft a structured presentation incorporating all key arguments and evidence.*

- **7.7. Develop Clear, Concise Campaign Messaging:**
    While several strong themes are discussed (freedom, democracy, local impact), these need to be refined into clear, concise, and memorable messages for different platforms and audiences. This includes finalizing the "sexier title" for the campaign (00:05:30), the core slogan for flyers (e.g., "Freedom to Roam Shore Road" or "Keep Swanage Two-Way"), and the "20 seconds, not 20 minutes" hook for the survey. The Other Speaker's suggestion of a "one-page manifesto" (03:39:00) is an actionable item to distill the campaign's essence.
  - *Specific next steps: Brainstorm and test different slogans and messages. Draft the one-page manifesto. Ensure consistency of messaging across all campaign materials.*

- **7.8. Gather Data on Survey Underrepresentation & Public Opinion:**
    Beyond the formal sentiment analysis, the campaign will anecdotally and systematically try to gather evidence of how the current survey is failing to capture true public opinion. This includes noting the positive reception during canvassing ("People were receptive because they could see the power behind it" - 03:44:00), asking people about their willingness to complete the full vs. hacked survey (02:22:00), and potentially collecting names for a petition (02:45:00). The aim is to build a case that the official survey results will not be a true reflection of community sentiment.
  - *Specific next steps: Develop a simple method for canvassers to record responses/feedback. Consider the logistics of a petition if deemed necessary. Collate all anecdotal evidence systematically.*

These actionable items demonstrate a clear intent to move from strategic discussion to tangible campaign activities, combining direct community engagement with technical analysis and political lobbying, all under the pressure of a tight deadline.
