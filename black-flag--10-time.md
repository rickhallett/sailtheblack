# Black Flag: Realistic Time Estimates

This is, of course, an estimation, as actual time can vary based on skill, efficiency, volunteer availability, and unforeseen circumstances. We'll categorize this by "Levels of Coverage/Impact."

**Assumptions:**

- **Core Team:** Primarily the Speaker (social/canvassing lead) and the Other Speaker (technical/strategic support).
- **Timeframe:** Approximately 30 days until the survey deadline.
- **Volunteer Base:** Assumed to be small or non-existent initially, meaning the core team bears most of the burden.

**Levels of Coverage & Estimated Man-Hours (Technical & Social):**

**Level 1: Basic Awareness & Targeted Mobilization (The "Survey Hack" Focus)**

- **Goal:** Ensure a core group of directly affected and easily reachable people (e.g., De Moulham Road residents, known contacts, existing social media circles) are aware of the survey "hack" and submit their preference for Option 3.
- **Activities & Estimated Man-Hours:**
  - **Technical (Other Speaker):**
    - **Facebook Page Setup & Basic Content:** 2-4 hours (initial setup, basic info, first few posts explaining the hack).
    - **Linktree Setup:** 0.5-1 hour.
    - **QR Code Generation:** 0.5 hours.
    - **Simple Flyer Design (Digital Template):** 1-2 hours (if providing template for Speaker to print).
    - **Initial Sentiment Analysis (Quick Pass):** 3-5 hours (reading survey, identifying obvious biases).
    - **Technical Support/Troubleshooting for Speaker:** 1-2 hours (spread throughout).
    - **Total Technical (Level 1): Approx. 8-14.5 hours**
  - **Social (Speaker):**
    - **Flyer Printing & Initial Distribution:** 4-6 hours (printing locally, initial targeted leaflet drops).
    - **Direct Canvassing (Highly Targeted - e.g., own street, immediate neighbours):** 10-15 hours (assumes ~50-75 households, 10-15 mins per effective contact).
    - **Personal Social Media Outreach (Existing Networks):** 5-8 hours (crafting messages, individual outreach, sharing on personal profiles).
    - **Networking with Key "Super Spreaders" (Initial Contact):** 3-5 hours (meetings/calls with Angelo, Carl, etc.).
    - **Total Social (Level 1): Approx. 22-34 hours**
  - **Total Man-Hours for Level 1: Approx. 30-48.5 hours** (Spread over the first 1-2 weeks)
- **Expected Outcome:** Several hundred targeted survey submissions. Increased awareness within immediate affected circles. Foundation for broader campaign laid.

**Level 2: Broader Community Engagement & Increased Visibility**

- **Goal:** Expand reach beyond immediate circles, actively engage a wider segment of the Swanage population, and start building a more visible public presence for the campaign.
- **Activities & Estimated Man-Hours (Includes Level 1, plus):**
  - **Technical (Other Speaker):**
    - **Enhanced Social Media Management:** 5-10 hours (regular posting, responding to comments, creating simple shareable graphics/memes based on Speaker's input, potentially basic Facebook ad setup if budget allows).
    - **More In-Depth Sentiment/Bias Report for Council:** 8-12 hours (detailed analysis, writing up findings).
    - **Developing a Simple Campaign "Manifesto" / Key Arguments Doc:** 3-5 hours (collaborating with Speaker).
    - **Researching Council Procedures/Contacts for Presentation:** 2-4 hours.
    - **Total Technical (Level 2): Approx. 18-31 hours (additional to Level 1, so ~26-45.5 total)**
  - **Social (Speaker):**
    - **Wider Flyer Distribution & Poster Campaign:** 10-15 hours (more streets, public noticeboards if allowed).
    - **Expanded Canvassing (More streets, engaging random people in town):** 20-30 hours (could reach several hundred more households/individuals).
    - **Organizing a Small Public Info Stall/Presence (e.g., Saturday market):** 5-8 hours (planning, setup, manning the stall for a few hours).
    - **Active Engagement in Local Facebook Groups:** 5-10 hours (monitoring discussions, sharing campaign info appropriately, responding to queries).
    - **Follow-up with "Super Spreaders" & Encouraging their Networks:** 5-8 hours.
    - **Initial Outreach to Local Councillors:** 3-5 hours (drafting emails, making calls).
    - **Total Social (Level 2): Approx. 48-76 hours (additional to Level 1, so ~70-110 total)**
  - **Total Man-Hours for Level 2: Approx. 66-107 hours (additional to Level 1, so ~96-155.5 total)** (Spread over 2-3 weeks)
- **Expected Outcome:** Potentially 1000+ survey submissions. Noticeable campaign presence in town and online. Initial engagement with local media/councillors. A clearer understanding of broader public sentiment.

**Level 3: High-Impact, Intensive Campaigning (Aiming for Significant Influence)**

- **Goal:** Maximize survey submissions from all sympathetic demographics, generate significant public and media attention, and prepare a robust case for Dorset County Council.
- **Activities & Estimated Man-Hours (Includes Levels 1 & 2, plus):**
  - **Technical (Other Speaker):**
    - **Data Collation & Presentation:** 10-15 hours (compiling canvassing feedback, survey "hack" uptake estimates, creating charts/visuals for council presentation).
    - **Targeted Digital Advertising (if budget allows):** 5-10 hours (managing and optimizing ads).
    - **Support for Media Outreach (e.g., creating press kit elements):** 3-5 hours.
    - **Researching & Rebutting Council's Data/Arguments:** 10-20 hours (if council releases counter-information).

  - **Social (Speaker):**
    - **Intensive, Systematic Canvassing of All Key Areas:** 30-50 hours (attempting near-saturation coverage in target zones).
    - **Organizing Larger Public Meetings/Events (if feasible):** 10-20 hours (logistics, promotion, hosting).
    - **Proactive Media Outreach (Local papers, radio):** 5-10 hours (drafting press releases, making calls, preparing for interviews).
    - **Direct Lobbying of Dorset County Councillors:** 10-15 hours (arranging meetings, preparing specific talking points for each).
    - **Coordinating any Volunteer Efforts:** 5-10 hours (if volunteers are recruited).
    - **Preparing and Rehearsing Council Presentation:** 8-12 hours.
    - **Potential Influencer Outreach (Jonathan Ross, etc. â€“ high effort, uncertain return):** 5-15 hours.
    - **Total Social (Level 3): Approx. 73-132 hours (additional to Level 2, so ~143-242 total)**
  - **Total Man-Hours for Level 3: Approx. 101-182 hours (additional to Level 2, so ~197-337.5 total)** (Intensive effort in the final 2 weeks)
- **Expected Outcome:** Several thousand survey submissions. Significant local media coverage. A well-prepared and evidence-backed presentation to Dorset County Council. A strong demonstration of public opposition to the unfavored road options.

**Important Considerations for Realism:**

- **Burnout:** These are significant time commitments, especially for a small core team. Burnout is a real risk.
- **Skill Gaps:** If the Other Speaker isn't proficient in, say, advanced data analysis or graphic design for infographics, those tasks will take longer or require outsourcing (if a budget exists, which is not implied).
- **Unforeseen Delays:** Life happens. Illness, personal commitments, or unexpected campaign roadblocks can derail timelines.
- **Council Response Time:** Getting meetings with councillors or responses to information requests can be slow and unpredictable.
- **Public Apathy/Resistance:** Not everyone will be receptive. Canvassing can be time-consuming with low conversion rates in some areas.
- **Volunteer Reliability:** If volunteers are involved, their commitment and reliability can vary, impacting the ability to scale efforts.
- **The "Unknown Unknowns":** Every campaign encounters unexpected challenges.

**Pragmatism:**

Given the 30-day timeframe and likely limited resources (primarily the two individuals), **Level 2 coverage is probably the most ambitious yet realistically achievable target.** Level 3 would require an extraordinary, near full-time commitment from both, and/or a significant, well-coordinated volunteer effort that doesn't currently seem to be in place.

The strategy should prioritize:
1. **Maximizing the "Survey Hack":** This is the highest leverage activity.
2. **Effective Social Media Dissemination:** Quickest way to reach many.
3. **Targeted Canvassing:** Focus on the most affected and potentially receptive areas.
4. **Solid Preparation for Council Engagement:** Even if outreach is limited, the case presented to the council must be strong.

It's crucial to continually assess progress against these time estimates and adjust tactics accordingly. If certain activities are consuming too much time for too little return, they may need to be deprioritized in favor of more impactful ones.
